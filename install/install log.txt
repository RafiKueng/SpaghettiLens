    Add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

    deb http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian/ testing main

    (Please note that the word testing in this line refers to the state of our release of RabbitMQ, not any particular Debian distribution. You can use it with Debian stable, testing or unstable, as well as with Ubuntu. We describe the release as "testing" to emphasise that we release somewhat frequently.)
    (optional) To avoid warnings about unsigned packages, add our public key to your trusted key list using apt-key(8):

    wget http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc
    sudo apt-key add rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc

    Run apt-get update.
    Install packages as usual; for instance,

    sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server

    
 rm rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc
